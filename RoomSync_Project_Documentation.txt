INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================

REACT FUNDAMENTALS
------------------

Q: What is React and why did you choose it?
A: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I chose it because:
   - Component-based architecture promotes reusability
   - Virtual DOM provides better performance
   - Large ecosystem and community support
   - Excellent developer tools and debugging
   - Modern development practices with hooks

Q: Explain the difference between functional and class components.
A: In my project, I used functional components because:
   - Simpler syntax and easier to read/maintain
   - Hooks provide all class component functionality
   - Better performance with React 18
   - Modern React development standard
   - Less boilerplate code required

Q: What are React Hooks and which ones did you use?
A: Hooks let you use state and lifecycle in functional components. I used:
   - useState: Managing component state (form data, loading states)
   - useEffect: API calls, cleanup functions, side effects
   - useContext: Accessing global authentication state
   - useNavigate: Programmatic navigation after login/logout

Q: How did you handle state management?
A: I used a combination approach:
   - Local state with useState for component-specific data
   - Context API for global authentication state
   - Props for parent-child communication
   - Service functions for API state management

Q: Explain the component lifecycle in functional components.
A: I used useEffect to handle lifecycle events:
   - Component mounting: useEffect with empty dependency array
   - Component updating: useEffect with specific dependencies
   - Component unmounting: useEffect cleanup functions
   - Conditional effects based on state changes

PROJECT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
--------------------------

Q: How did you implement authentication?
A: I implemented JWT-based authentication:
   - Backend generates JWT tokens on successful login
   - Frontend stores tokens in localStorage
   - Protected routes check token validity using middleware
   - Automatic logout on token expiration
   - Role-based access control for different user types

Q: Explain your routing strategy.
A: I used React Router DOM with:
   - Public routes: /, /login, /signup, /aboutus, /contactus
   - Protected routes: /dashboard/* with authentication middleware
   - Role-based routing for different user types (user/owner/admin)
   - Nested routing for dashboard sections
   - Programmatic navigation based on user roles

Q: How did you handle API calls?
A: I created service functions using Axios:
   - Centralized API configuration with base URLs
   - Error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Loading states for better user experience
   - Token attachment for authenticated requests
   - Response interceptors for global error handling

Q: What about form validation?
A: I implemented comprehensive client-side validation:
   - Required field validation
   - Email format validation using regex patterns
   - Password strength requirements (6+ chars, numbers)
   - Real-time feedback with toast notifications
   - Form state management with controlled components

Q: How did you handle different user roles?
A: I implemented role-based access control:
   - Different dashboard layouts for each role
   - Protected routes based on user role
   - Role-specific navigation menus
   - Conditional rendering based on user permissions
   - Separate API endpoints for each role

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------

Q: How did you ensure responsive design?
A: I used Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS:
   - Mobile-first approach in development
   - Responsive grid system (col-md, col-lg)
   - Flexible components that adapt to screen sizes
   - CSS media queries for custom styling
   - Touch-friendly interface elements

Q: How did you handle file uploads?
A: I used Multer on the backend:
   - Configured storage destination and filename generation
   - File type validation (images only)
   - File size limitations for performance
   - Frontend preview functionality before upload
   - Error handling for upload failures

Q: What about security measures?
A: I implemented several security features:
   - Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
   - JWT token expiration and validation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Admin key validation for admin registration

Q: How did you handle errors and loading states?
A: I implemented comprehensive error handling:
   - Try-catch blocks for all async operations
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Loading states with disabled buttons
   - Error boundaries for component-level errors
   - Graceful fallbacks for failed API calls

PERFORMANCE & BEST PRACTICES
-----------------------------

Q: How did you optimize performance?
A: I used several optimization techniques:
   - Component memoization where appropriate
   - Lazy loading for route components
   - Image optimization and compression
   - Efficient re-rendering with proper key props
   - Debouncing for search functionality

Q: What coding standards did you follow?
A: I maintained clean code practices:

   - Component separation by functionality
   - Reusable utility functions and services
   - Proper error handling throughout the application
   - Code organization in logical folder structures
   - Comments for complex business logic

   - Separation of concerns (UI vs logic)
   - Custom hooks for shared logic

DATABASE & BACKEND QUESTIONS
-----------------------------

Q: How did you design your database schema?
A: I designed a normalized relational database:
   - Users table with role-based differentiation
   - Properties table with owner relationships
   - Bookings table linking users and properties
   - Foreign key constraints for data integrity
   - Indexed columns for query performance

Q: Explain your API design.
A: I followed RESTful API principles:
   - Resource-based URLs (/api/users, /api/properties)
   - HTTP methods for different operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Consistent response formats with status codes
   - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Authentication middleware for protected endpoints

Q: How did you handle database connections?
A: I used MySQL with proper connection management:
